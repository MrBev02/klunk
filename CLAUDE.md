# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository.

## What Klunk is

A point-and-click exam paper builder for teachers who should not have to touch a
terminal. It runs entirely in the browser: no server, no account, no database, no
API key, and **no network requests after the page loads**.

Built for the Design faculty at the user's school. Target courses are **NSW HSC
Design and Technology** and **IB DP Design Technology**. Textiles and Design is also
supported by the syllabus generator.

The user is a teacher with 20+ years of software and management experience. No
sycophancy, no flattery, challenge weak reasoning, plan before producing.

## Non-negotiable constraints

These are decisions with reasons, not preferences. Do not quietly reverse them.

**1. No exam content in this repository. It is public.**
Question banks, papers, templates and syllabus models live in a folder the teacher
chooses at runtime, normally a school OneDrive or Teams folder. `.gitignore` enforces
this. Before any commit, check nothing under `bank/`, `papers/`, `templates/`,
`syllabus/*.json`, or any `.docx`/`.pdf` has been staged.

**2. Klunk ships no syllabus models, only generators.**
A syllabus is copyright. The NESA Stage 6 (2013) notice permits a NSW teacher to copy
*reasonable portions* for bona fide study, and forbids reproducing a major extract,
modifying the material, or commercial use. IB subject-guide content is licensed
through the Programme Resource Centre. A generated model is the entire content
inventory, restructured, published worldwide: not a reasonable portion under anyone's
reading. Each teacher generates from their own copy into their own folder.

*Profiles are different and DO ship.* A profile records the shape of a public
examination (40 marks, three sections at 10/15/15), which is fact, not NESA's
expression of its syllabus.

**3. No AI inside the app.**
The app talks to no AI service and holds no API key. Where an AI genuinely helps, the
app composes a prompt with the syllabus context filled in; the teacher pastes it into
whatever their school licenses (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) and pastes the
structured result back for validation. This means no vendor dependency, and the
teacher decides exactly what text leaves their machine.

**4. The no-network claim is enforced, not promised.**
The CSP in `index.html` sets `connect-src 'none'`. If a change needs the network, that
has to be a deliberate decision that revisits the privacy claim at the same time.

## Layout

```
klunk/                     this repo - app and tools only, public
  schemas/                 the four JSON formats
  profiles/                paper rules per course (these DO ship)
  tools/                   syllabus generators (Python, stdlib only)
  src/                     the app (Vite + TypeScript + Preact)
    fixtures/              fictional sample data for development
../klunk-content/          NOT in git - the teacher's content folder equivalent
  source/                  downloaded syllabus docs and past papers
  syllabus/                generated models
  fixtures/                docx kept purely as parser regression tests
  tools/docx_text.py       authoring aid for reading .docx
```

`../klunk-content` is a sibling of this repo and is where all real content lives
during development. It is deliberately outside the repo so it cannot be committed.

## The four formats

All defined in `schemas/`, all validated with real data.

| Schema | Holds | Key decision |
|---|---|---|
| `syllabus.schema.json` | Courses, outcomes, topics, content points | Stable local ids (`HSC-01.07`); topics carry `group` for focus areas |
| `profile.schema.json` | Paper structure and rules per course | Everything the old toolchain hardcoded lives here as data |
| `bank.schema.json` | Questions | References syllabus by **stable id**, not a `A > B > C` path string; carries provenance |
| `paper.schema.json` | An exam as a selection of questions | By reference, never by copy |

Question types are D&T-relevant only: `multiple_choice`, `true_false`, `short_answer`,
`extended_response`, `table`, `drawing`. No `sql`, `spreadsheet` or `python`.

Two deliberate divergences worth preserving:
- **Stable ids over path strings.** A path breaks the moment a topic is renamed.
- **Provenance on every question.** Reusing a recent HSC question in a school trial is
  a mistake that actually happens; Klunk can only warn if the source year and number
  were recorded.

## Verified facts, established from real sources

Do not re-derive these, and do not contradict them without new evidence.

**HSC D&T written paper, from 11 years of papers (2015-2025):**
- Fixed: 40 marks; Sections I/II/III at 10/15/15; exactly ten 1-mark objective
  questions; Section III is one extended response; `Question N (M marks)` headings.
- Varies: MC option labels changed from `(A)` to `A.` in **2017**; Section II ran 2, 3
  and 4 questions in different years; `Question N (continued)` blocks appear from 2018
  (1-4 per paper) and must merge into the parent, not register as new questions; two
  different front-matter layouts.
- **Every paper has a text layer**, so deterministic parsing works and no OCR or
  vision is needed.

**NESA Stage 6 (2013) syllabuses use two content layouts:**
- *Wide*: one 3-column table per course, `Outcomes | Students learn about | Students
  learn to`, outcome cell blank on continuation rows. Design and Technology.
- *Narrow*: many 2-column tables, no outcome column; each row is a topic and outcomes
  appear as paragraphs above. Textiles and Design.
- Course membership comes from the outcome code prefix (P/H), or a `(Preliminary)` /
  `(HSC)` marker. Relying only on `Content: ... HSC` headings silently misfiles whole
  courses.

**IB DP Design Technology changed:** first teaching August 2025, first assessment May
2027. Six core topics plus four HL options became three themes; Paper 3 abolished. **No
past paper exists for the new course**, so its bank must be authored from the subject
guide, not extracted. Do not promise IB extraction.

**Dropped from scope:** Industrial Technology and Food Technology. Their `.docx` files
are kept in `../klunk-content/fixtures/` purely as parser regression tests.

## Conventions

- **Australian English** throughout (visualisation, analyse, behaviour, customise),
  AUD for currency, metric, A4.
- **Python**: stdlib only, 3.11+, `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and no PEP 723 block since
  there are no dependencies. Native generics, `from __future__ import annotations`,
  frozen dataclasses, Google-style docstrings. Catch exceptions only where there is a
  specific recovery.
- **Commit messages**: descriptive sentences, not Conventional Commits. Say what
  changed and why it mattered. Record corrections honestly rather than quietly fixing.
- Comments explain **why**, not what.

## Running things

```
npm install
npm run dev            # dev server
npm test               # vitest, the paper checker and shuffle logic
npm run build          # typecheck, then tests, then dist/ for GitHub Pages
npm run build:single   # dist-single/ one self-contained HTML for a shared drive
npm run typecheck

# Generate a syllabus model from a NESA Stage 6 .docx
python3 tools/nesa_stage6_syllabus.py <syllabus.docx> \
    --id nsw-hsc-design-technology --name "Design and Technology" \
    --out ../klunk-content/syllabus/nsw-hsc-design-technology.json

# Validate schemas and data (uv, because this Python's ensurepip is broken)
uv run --with jsonschema python <validation script>
```

Regression check for the generator: Design and Technology must stay at
**20 topics / 78 points / 12 outcomes** (Preliminary) and **20 / 61 / 13** (HSC).

## Environment gotchas

- **Git pushes hang.** Two credential helpers are configured and Git Credential Manager
  blocks forever on a GUI prompt in a non-interactive shell. This repo is pinned to
  `gh auth git-credential` locally, so pushes work here. Other repos on this machine
  are not.
- **Git identity is set locally** to MrBev02, because the machine's global identity is
  a different account.
- `python3 -m venv` fails (`ensurepip` broken). Use `uv`.
- The Chrome browser tools attach to a **different machine**, so the app cannot be
  verified in a browser from here. Ask the user to check visually.
  *Already confirmed on the user's machine:* the deployed page renders, and folder
  access reports **Supported**. Do not ask again unless something changes.

## Work is tracked in GitHub issues

**All work lands in an issue and is worked from there, unless the user says
otherwise.** `gh` is authenticated as MrBev02 and this repo is `MrBev02/klunk`.

Before starting anything:

```
gh issue list                 # what is open
gh issue view <n>             # the full context, which is usually already written
```

The rules:

- **Find or file the issue first.** If the user asks for something with no issue,
  create one before writing code, so the reasoning survives the session. A one-line
  issue is fine; the point is that it exists.
- **Put the reasoning in the issue, not just the title.** What is broken or missing,
  what it depends on, what "done" means. Several existing issues carry findings that
  cost real effort to establish, such as how NESA paper formats vary by year. Read
  them rather than re-deriving.
- **Reference the issue in the commit** (`Closes #5`, or `Refs #3` for partial work),
  so history explains itself.
- **Do not close an issue you have not verified.** This project has a habit of
  checking in a browser rather than reasoning from the source, and that habit has
  caught several faults that reading the code did not.
- **File what you find.** Noticing a defect while doing something else is normal;
  filing it and carrying on is better than either fixing it silently or forgetting.

Labels: `feature`, `bug`, `gap` (promised but not built), `content` (syllabus or
bank authoring), `deferred` (waiting on evidence or input).

## Status and what is next

Done: repo and CI (Pages deploys green), capability detection, syllabus generator for
both NESA layouts, all four schemas validated with positive and negative tests, HSC D&T
profile, development fixtures covering all five question types. The deployed page has
been opened on the user's machine: it renders, and **the File System Access API is
supported there**, so the folder-based storage model is confirmed rather than assumed.

The app opens a folder, reads it, browses questions with full detail, builds a paper
against a profile, checks it, prints the student paper and marking guide to PDF, and
saves papers back to the folder. `npm run build` gates on the tests, so a broken
checker fails the Pages deploy rather than shipping.

Verified end to end in a browser, not just reasoned about: a complete 40-mark paper
assembles, the checker goes green, it saves to `papers/`, survives a hard reload and
reopens with every reference resolving. Stimulus images load from the content folder
and print. A missing image still prints a placeholder naming the file, deliberately,
so it is caught on the proof rather than in the exam room.

Paper references survive a moved or renamed bank: exact path, then same filename,
then a globally unique question id, with ambiguity reported rather than guessed.

Note on history: the commit "Papers survive a moved or renamed bank" also contains
the stimulus-image loading, which its message does not mention.

Next is in the issue tracker. `gh issue list` is the authoritative backlog; this
section only says where to start.

The gap that blocks everything else: **a teacher cannot create a question in the
app**, so a new user's bank stays empty however good the paper builder is. That is
issue #1, with the prompt factory (#2) directly after it, since the two together
are what make Klunk self-sufficient rather than dependent on someone hand-writing
JSON.

Issue #5 is a small defect worth clearing whenever convenient: stimulus image object
URLs are never revoked.

**Word export is deliberately not built.** It only earns its complexity if teachers
actually want to hand-edit papers, and the user wants to gauge demand first. If it
comes back: merge into the school's own `.docx` template so cover page, headers and
styles survive, rather than generating a document from scratch.

**Waiting on the user:** the school's exam template `.docx` (only needed if Word
returns), and the IB subject guide plus the official old-to-new topic mapping
spreadsheet.
